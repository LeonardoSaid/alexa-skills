# Basic Smart Home Skill

This is meant to be a private skill used to manage your IoT devices, instead of making a more complex Smart Home Skill with Account Linking, you can use a basic Intent Skill like this one to simply execute your API requests from your private server.

## Usage

Copy the content to a new Skill in Alexa Developer Console and turn on Test Development mode, for every API request you can customize a new Intent as you see fit.
